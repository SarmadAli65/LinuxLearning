# LinuxLearning

A personal repository documenting my exploration of Linux, from understanding the terminal to learning essential commands and concepts.

This repo includes:

 * Key Linux concepts and terminology

 * Essential shell commands (with examples)

 * Notes on file systems, permissions, users, and environment variables

 * Tips, tricks, and commands Iâ€™ve found especially useful

 * Resources and references for further learning

Whether you're just starting with Linux or brushing up on the basics, feel free to explore, clone, and contribute.
